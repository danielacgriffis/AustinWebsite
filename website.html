		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Austin, also known as one of the best new cities to live in, has not always been the booming town we know and love. Originally named Waterloo, immigrants from Germany, Sweden, and Mexico occupied this settlement. After a large population growth, Austin was renamed and declared the capital in 1839.  During the 1850s-1880s, Austin began constructing many of the buildings we still see today; like the Capitol Building, The University of Texas at Austin and even the famous Driskill Hotel. </p>

		<p>One of Austin's famous aspects is the music scene. Also known as "The Live Music Capital of the World," Austin's live music grew during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. In the 1960s, 6th street opened and showcased many live music venues for up and coming musical artists. Ranging from Folk to country to reggae to rap, Austin is still exhibiting lively music. This city's love for music is especially shown in its annual music festival called Austin City Limits. Also known as ACL, this outdoor concert showcases many popular artists in Zilker Park. </p>

		<h3>Culture</h3>
		<p>Similar to showcasing different mediums of art, Austin prides itself on the celebration of different cultures, and ethnicities. The strong historical ties Texas has with Mexico has led the city to have a strong Latino presence. This is shown through local food, museum, events, and associations. Some attractions that showcase this strong presence is the Mexic-Arte Museum. This display, which is located downtown, offers year-round exhibitions in contemporary Latin American art and culture.  </p>
		<p>Although this city is mostly known for its Latino presence, the African American community is thriving in East Austin. The Six Square, which is one of the largest cultural districts in the country, hold many historically significant sites through exhibits, performances, festivals and other events. One famous cultural center is the Ballet Afrique, which was started in 2008 by China Smith. This dance academy showcases professional dance companies and teaches youth through contemporary dance.  </p>

		<p>Not only does ATX celebrate all races, it also pushes to be accepting of all peoples, including the LGBT community. Most cities have a well known "gay district," but Austin is famous for being truly inclusive of all its residents. The LGBT community is well known for rebuilding and revitalizing Austin neighborhoods.
